  <main>
    <p> I have many hobbies because I love learning about new things as much as possible. I enjoy reading and watching movies(explains my film minor). I love comics, DND, Warhammer and a bunch of other nerdy stuff.I enjoy playing video games both by myself and with friends. I enjoy hanging out with friends and family any chance I get. i like to listen and play music, I picked up guitar about 4 years and have enjoyed it ever since. Overall, I love learning about new things and trying anyhting I can.</p>
