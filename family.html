    <h1> My Family</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p> My parents are Bill and Joyce Temanson. My mom is an kindergarden teacher and my dad is a carpenter. They both live in my home town of Pratt, KS. I have 2 older brothers, starting with the oldest we have Eli. Eli works on a feedlot in Cunningham, KS. He is getting married to his fiance in October, her name is Brooke. She is a hairstylist in Cunningham, and is the first addition to our family. My other brother is Aden, and he is a business education major at Fort Hays State University. Aden is my best friend, we grew up close together and try to talk as much as possible.</p>
   
    <p class ="words"> I also have pets: I have 2 dogs name Zeus and Dodger, and I have a cat named Cha-Cha. Zeus and Dodger live with my parents and Cha-Cha lives at my old work. Zeus is 8 years old and is a large german shepard and boxer mix. Dodger is 14 years old and is a small poodle shi-tzu mix. Cha-Cha is stray that was picked up by my vet and I helped nurse her back to health so I grew very attached.</p>
